# react-analytics-tracker

`react-analytics-tracker` is a React component for tracking user interactions and events on your web application. This component captures click and view events, collects various data points, and reports them to a specified endpoint.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install react-analytics-tracker
```

or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-analytics-tracker
```

## Usage

To use the `AnalyticsTracker` component, wrap it around your application or specific parts of your application where you want to track user interactions.

## Basic Example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { AnalyticsTracker } from "react-analytics-tracker";

const App = () => (
  <AnalyticsTracker
    appName="MyApp"
    appVersion="1.0.0"
    reportingEndpoint="https://your-endpoint.com/report"
  >
    {/* Your application components */}
  </AnalyticsTracker>
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## Track Your Component View

To track a component view, add the `data-component` attribute to the component element. Optionally, include additional data using the `data-component-data` attribute.

### Example:

```jsx
<div data-component="YourComponent" data-component-data="additionalData">
  {/* Your component content */}
</div>
```

## Track Your Clicks

To track a click event, add the `data-element` attribute to the clickable element. If `data-element` is not present, the tag name of the element will be used for tracking. Optionally, include extra data using the `data-element-data` attribute.

### Example:

```jsx
<button data-element="ButtonElement" data-element-data="extraData">
  Click me
</button>
```

## Track Your Other Events

To track any of these following events

`"click","mouseover","mouseout","mouseup","mousedown","mousemove","mouseenter","mouseleave","mouseover mouseout","dblclick","contextmenu","submit","reset","touchstart","touchmove","touchend","touchcancel","change","focus","blur","keypress","select","keyup","keydown"`

First add the `data-event` attribute to the element you want to make eligible to track according to the event. The tracking will take place for the provided valid value of `data-event` only. Possible values for `data-event` are as above. Then add the `data-element` attribute to the element. If `data-element` is not present, the tag name of the element will be used for tracking. Optionally, include extra data using the `data-element-data` attribute.

### Example:

```jsx
<button
  data-event="mouseover"
  data-element="ButtonElement"
  data-element-data="extraData"
>
  Interact with me
</button>
```

## Props

The `AnalyticsTracker` component accepts the following props:

- `appName` (optional) : Specifies the application name to include in the analytics payload sent to the server

- `appVersion` (optional) : Specifies the application version to include in the analytics payload sent to the server

- `heartBeatInterval` (optional): Specifies the interval (in milliseconds) for sending periodic heartbeat reports. Defaults to 4000 milliseconds.

- `customPayload` (optional): An object containing custom data to include in the analytics payload sent to the server.

- `customProperties` (optional): An object containing custom properties to add to each tracked event in the analytics payload.

- `reportingEndpoint` (optional): If provided, specifies the endpoint where the analytics payload will be POSTed. Either `reportingEndpoint` or `onReport` is required for reporting.

- `onReport` (optional): A function that will be called when reporting analytics data. Use this for manual handling of analytics data if `reportingEndpoint` is not provided or for additional logic alongside endpoint reporting.

### Example usage:

```jsx
<AnalyticsTracker
  appName="MyApp"
  appVersion="1.0.0"
  heartBeatInterval={5000}
  customPayload={{ projectId: "12345" }}
  reportingEndpoint="https://example.com/analytics"
  onReport={(payload) => {
    console.log("Custom onReport function called with payload:", payload);
    // Additional logic can be added here
  }}
>
  {/* Your application components */}
</AnalyticsTracker>
```

## Customization

### Custom Payload

You can customize the payload sent to the reporting endpoint by passing a `customPayload` prop to the `AnalyticsTracker` component.

```jsx
<AnalyticsTracker
  appName="MyApp"
  appVersion="1.0.0"
  reportingEndpoint="https://your-endpoint.com/report"
  customPayload={{ userId: "12345", additionalInfo: "extra data" }}
>
  <YourComponent />
</AnalyticsTracker>
```

### Custom Properties

You can include custom properties with each tracked event by passing a customProperties prop to the AnalyticsTracker component.

```jsx
<AnalyticsTracker
  appName="MyApp"
  appVersion="1.0.0"
  reportingEndpoint="https://your-endpoint.com/report"
  customProperties={{ environment: "production" }}
>
  <YourComponent />
</AnalyticsTracker>
```

### Tracking Custom Events

Not only clicks and views, you can implement your own custom events for your purpose with `react-analytics-tracker`. For custom events beyond clicks and views, use the `trackCustomEvent` method wrapped with `AnalyticsProvider` with same props as of `AnalyticsTracker`.

#### Example

First, wrap your application with `AnalyticsProvider`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { AnalyticsProvider } from "react-analytics-tracker";

const App = () => (
  <AnalyticsProvider
    appName="MyApp"
    appVersion="1.0.0"
    reportingEndpoint="https://your-endpoint.com/report"
  >
    {/* Your application components */}
  </AnalyticsProvider>
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

Then, use withAnalytics HOC in the component where you want to use the custom event. And thus your tracker instance will be ready and available at the props

```jsx
import { withAnalytics } from "react-analytics-tracker";

// Define a component where you want to track custom events
const CustomComponent = ({ tracker }) => {
  const handleEvent = () => {
    const customEventData = {
      eventData: "Additional event data",
      elementName: "customElement",
      componentName: "CustomComponent",
    };
    tracker.trackCustomEvent("customEventName", customEventData, true);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component content */}
      <button onDoubleClick={handleEvent}>Trigger Custom Event</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default withAnalytics(CustomComponent);
```

### trackCustomEvent Method

The trackCustomEvent method allows tracking of custom events with specific event details:

- `eventName`: A string representing the name of the custom event.

- `data`: An object conforming to the TrackData interface, containing:

  - `eventData`: Additional data related to the event.

  - `elementName`: Name or identifier of the UI element triggering the event.
  - `componentName`: Name or identifier of the React component where the event occurred.

- `isToReportImmediately (optional)`: A boolean flag. If true, the event will be reported immediately after tracking. If false or omitted, the event will be queued for periodic reporting as per the configured rules.

```ts
interface TrackData {
  eventData: string | null;
  elementName: string | null;
  componentName: string | null;
}
```

## How it works

The react-analytics-tracker package provides a way to track user interactions and page views within a React application. It leverages various web APIs and techniques to gather and report analytics data effectively. Hereâ€™s an overview of its functionality:

- ### Session Management

  Upon initialization, AnalyticsTracker generates a unique session ID (sessionId) for each user. This ID is stored in sessionStorage to track user sessions across different page views.

- ### Event Tracking

  #### Click Events

  When a user clicks on an element in the DOM, the AnalyticsTracker captures the event details such as coordinates, element attributes (data-element), and contextual information. These events are queued and reported periodically or immediately if configured.

  #### Viewport Visibility

  Using the IntersectionObserver, the tracker monitors when components become visible in the viewport (view events). It calculates the percentage of the component visible and reports this information along with optional additional data (data-component-data).

- ### Reporting

  The tracker allows reporting of accumulated events to either a specified reportingEndpoint via HTTP POST requests or to a custom handler (onReport function) for manual processing.

  The tracker allows reporting in three scenarios:

  1. `Heartbeat Interval`: Events are reported periodically based on the `heartBeatInterval` prop set in the `AnalyticsTracker` component.
     The component sends periodic heartbeat reports to the endpoint to keep track of the session. The default interval is 4000 milliseconds (4 seconds). You can customize this interval by passing a heartBeatInterval prop.

     ```jsx
     <AnalyticsTracker
       appName="MyApp"
       appVersion="1.0.0"
       reportingEndpoint="https://your-endpoint.com/report"
       heartBeatInterval={10000} // 10 seconds
     >
       <YourComponent />
     </AnalyticsTracker>
     ```

  2. `Queue Size`: Events are reported when the queue size reaches 5.

  3. `Page Visibility`: Events are reported when the user changes tabs or minimizes the screen, utilizing the Page Visibility API.

  This flexibility enables integration with various analytics services or custom backend systems.

- ### Error Handling and Event Persistence

  To ensure no events are lost in case of reporting failures, the tracker maintains a failedCount flag for each event. If an event fails to report, it is stored in sessionStorage and its failedCount is incremented. Events with a failedCount of 3 or more are discarded to avoid infinite loops and data overload.

- ### Network and User Environment

  The tracker also captures details about the userâ€™s network connection (navigator.connection) and environment (screen size, language) to provide additional context to analytics reports.

- ### Event Debouncing

  Interaction events are debounced to avoid multiple reports in quick succession. The debounce time is set to 300 milliseconds by default

## Payload Generation

The payload object used in react-analytics-tracker encapsulates various pieces of information about the userâ€™s interaction and environment. Hereâ€™s an interface that describes the structure of the payload object:

```tsx
interface AnalyticsPayload {
  referrer: string; // Referring URL of the current page
  url: string; // Current URL
  pathname: string; // Path part of the URL
  hostname: string; // Hostname of the current URL
  title: string; // Title of the current document
  screen: string; // Screen dimensions (width x height)
  language: string; // User's preferred language
  utmSource: string; // UTM source parameter from cookies
  utmMedium: string; // UTM medium parameter from cookies
  utmCampaign: string; // UTM campaign parameter from cookies
  utmTerm: string; // UTM term parameter from cookies
  utmContent: string; // UTM content parameter from cookies
  sessionId: string; // Unique session identifier
  network: {
    // Network connection details
    rtt: number | undefined; // Round-trip time
    type: string | undefined; // Connection type
    saveData: boolean | undefined; // Data-saving mode
    downLink: number | undefined; // Downlink speed
    effectiveType: string | undefined; // Effective connection type
    isOnline: boolean; // Online status
  };
  events: Array<{
    // Array of tracked events
    data: string; // Event data (JSON stringified)
    event: string; // Event type ('click' or 'view')
    element: string | null; // Element name or tag name
    component: string; // Component name
    timestamp: number; // Timestamp of the event
    [key: string]: any; // Additional custom properties
  }>;
  [key: string]: any; // Additional custom properties
}
```

### Usage

When using the onReport function callback or customizing the payload structure, developers should import AnalyticsPayload and reference it as follows:

```tsx
import { AnalyticsPayload } from "react-analytics-tracker";

// Example usage of onReport with AnalyticsPayload
const handleReport = (payload: AnalyticsPayload) => {
  // Implement custom logic to handle the payload
  console.log("Reporting payload:", payload);
};

// Usage within your AnalyticsTracker component
<AnalyticsTracker onReport={handleReport}>
  {/* Your application components */}
</AnalyticsTracker>;
```
